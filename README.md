# Rabin-Karp-Final-Project
# In this file I implemented the Rabin-Karp string search algorithm. The original agorithm is used to find pattern matches and is primarily used for detecting plagiarism. I did a simple implementation where the user can give the location of a file they would like to test for plagiarism and then input a string they would like to look for in the file. This is a very small scale implementation of what this algorithm is used for. The implementation then extracts all the text from the text input file and stores it into a string which will be inputted into the search function. Next the search algorithm takes 3 inputs which are 1. the pattern to test for 2. the file to search in. and 3. variable q which is a hardcoded prime number in this case 101. It will use these inputs to begin its search function. The way that it actually works is in my white paper. The spin that i put onto this algorithm for my implementation is that the user can chose which file to input and search through rather than the usual automated state of the function used in industry. I have included a test case for anyone to use but you may use your own .txt files if you wish, it will work with anything. The test file says "hello there is a dog in this sentence." and I chose to search for the pattern "dog" which appears at index 17 as output by the search function. Again, you can input any file you chose and search for anything that wish within that file.
